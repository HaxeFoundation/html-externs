The <strong><code>FileSystemEntry</code></strong> interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a single in a file system. The entry can be a file or a directory (directories are represented by the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DirectoryEntry" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DirectoryEntry</code></a> interface). It includes methods for working with files—including copying, moving, removing, and reading files—as well as information about a file it points to—including the file name and its path from the root to the entry.
