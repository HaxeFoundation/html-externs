The <strong><code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code></strong> object (the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker" title="The SharedWorker interface represents a specific kind of worker that can be accessed from several browsing contexts, such as several windows, iframes or even workers. They implement an interface different than dedicated workers and have a different global scope, SharedWorkerGlobalScope."><code>SharedWorker</code></a> global scope) is accessible through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/self" title="The Window.self read-only property returns the window itself, as a WindowProxy. It can be used with dot notation on a window object (that is, window.self) or standalone (self). The advantage of the standalone notation is that a similar notation exists for non-window contexts, such as in Web Workers. By using self, you can refer to the global scope in a way that will work not only in a window context (self will resolve to window.self) but also in a worker context (self will then resolve to WorkerGlobalScope.self)."><code>self</code></a> keyword. Some additional global functions, namespaces objects, and constructors, not typically associated with the worker global scope, but available on it, are listed in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">JavaScript Reference</a>.
