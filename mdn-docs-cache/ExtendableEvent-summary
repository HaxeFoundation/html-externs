The <strong><code>ExtendableEvent</code></strong> interface extends the lifetime of the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/install" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/install">install</a></code> and <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/activate" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/activate">activate</a></code> events dispatched on the global scope as part of the service worker lifecycle. This ensures that any functional events (like <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent" title="This is the event type for fetch events dispatched on the service worker global scope. It contains information about the fetch, including the request and how the receiver will treat the response. It provides the event.respondWith() method, which allows us to provide a response to this fetch."><code>FetchEvent</code></a>) are not dispatched until it upgrades database schemas and deletes the outdated cache entries.
