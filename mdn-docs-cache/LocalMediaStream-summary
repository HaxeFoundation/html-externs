The <strong><code>LocalMediaStream</code></strong><strong> </strong>interface was part of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API">Media Capture and Streams API</a>, representing a stream of data being generated locally (such as by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia" title="The MediaDevices getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media."><code>getUserMedia()</code></a>. However, <code>getUserMedia()</code> now returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream" title="The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks such asÂ video or audio tracks. Each track is specified as an instance of MediaStreamTrack."><code>MediaStream</code></a> instead, and this interface has been removed from the specification.
