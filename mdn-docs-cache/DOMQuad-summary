A <code>DOMQuad</code> is a collection of four <code>DOMPoint</code>s defining the corners of an arbitrary quadrilateral. Returning <code>DOMQuad</code>s lets <code>getBoxQuads()</code> return accurate information even when arbitrary 2D or 3D transforms are present. It has a handy <code>bounds</code> attribute returning a <code>DOMRectReadOnly</code> for those cases where you just want an axis-aligned bounding rectangle.
