The <code>ConvolverNode</code> interface is an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode" title="The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module. Examples include:"><code>AudioNode</code></a> that performs a Linear Convolution on a given <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBuffer" title="Objects of these types are designed to hold small audio snippets, typically less than 45 s. For longer sounds, objects implementing the MediaElementAudioSourceNode are more suitable. The buffer contains data in the following format:  non-interleaved IEEE754 32-bit linear PCM with a nominal range between -1 and +1, that is, 32bits floating point buffer, with each samples between -1.0 and 1.0. If the AudioBuffer has multiple channels, they are stored in separate buffer."><code>AudioBuffer</code></a>, often used to achieve a reverb effect. A <code>ConvolverNode</code> always has exactly one input and one output.
