The <code>AudioScheduledSourceNode</code> interface—part of the Web Audio API—is a parent interface for several types of audio source node interfaces which share the ability to be started and stopped, optionally at specified times. Specifically, this interface defines the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioScheduledSourceNode/start" title="undefined"><code>start()</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioScheduledSourceNode/stop" title="The stop() method on AudioScheduledSourceNode schedules a sound to cease playback at the specified time. If no time is specified, then the sound stops playing immediately."><code>stop()</code></a> methods, as well as the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioScheduledSourceNode/onended" title="The onended event handler for the AudioScheduledSourceNode interface specifies an EventHandler to be executed when the ended event occurs on the node. This event is sent to the node when the concrete interface (such as AudioBufferSourceNode, OscillatorNode, or ConstantSourceNode) determines that it has stopped playing."><code>onended</code></a> event handler.
