<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.currentDirection", "currentDirection")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}</dt>
 <dd>A string from the enum {{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiverDirection")}} which indicates the transceiver's current directionality, or <code>null</code> if the transceiver is stopped or has never participated in an exchange of offers and answers.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.direction", "direction")}}</dt>
 <dd>A string from the enum {{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiverDirection")}} which is used to set the transceiver's desired direction.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.mid", "mid")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}</dt>
 <dd>The media ID of the m-line associated with this transceiver. This association is established, when possible, whenever either a local or remote description is applied. This field is <code>null</code> if neither a local or remote description has been applied, or if its associated m-line is rejected by either a remote offer or any answer.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.receiver", "receiver")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}</dt>
 <dd>The {{domxref("RTCRtpReceiver")}} object that handles receiving and decoding incoming media.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.sender", "sender")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}</dt>
 <dd>The {{domxref("RTCRtpSender")}} object responsible for encoding and sending data to the remote peer.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.stopped", "stopped")}}</dt>
 <dd>Indicates whether or not sending and receiving using the paired <code>RTCRtpSender</code> and <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code> has been permanently disabled, either due to SDP offer/answer, or due to a call to {{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver.stop", "stop()")}}.</dd>
