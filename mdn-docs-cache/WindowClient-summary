The <code>WindowClient</code> interface of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API">ServiceWorker API</a> represents the scope of a service worker client that is a document in a browser context, controlled by an active worker. The service worker client independently selects and uses a service worker for its own loading and sub-resources.
