The <code><strong>Event</strong></code> interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which useÂ other interfaces based on the main <code>Event</code> interface. <code>Event</code> itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.
