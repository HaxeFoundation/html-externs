The <code>ConstantSourceNode</code> interface—part of the Web Audio API—represents an audio source (based upon <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioScheduledSourceNode" title="The AudioScheduledSourceNode interface—part of the Web Audio API—is a parent interface for several types of audio source node interfaces which share the ability to be started and stopped, optionally at specified times. Specifically, this interface defines the start() and stop() methods, as well as the onended event handler."><code>AudioScheduledSourceNode</code></a>) whose output is single unchanging value. This makes it useful for cases in which you need a constant value coming in from an audio source. In addition, it can be used like a constructible <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam" title="The Web Audio API's AudioParam interface represents an audio-related parameter, usually a parameter of an AudioNode (such as GainNode.gain)."><code>AudioParam</code></a> by automating the value of its <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ConstantSourceNode/offset" title="The read-only offset property of the ConstantSourceNode interface returns a AudioParam object indicating the numeric a-rate value which is always returned by the source when asked for the next sample."><code>offset</code></a> or by connecting another node to it; see <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Controlling_multiple_parameters_with_ConstantSourceNode">Controlling multiple parameters with ConstantSourceNode</a>.
