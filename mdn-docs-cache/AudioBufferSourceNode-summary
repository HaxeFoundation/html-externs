The <strong><code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code></strong><strong> </strong>interface is an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioScheduledSourceNode" title="The AudioScheduledSourceNode interface—part of the Web Audio API—is a parent interface for several types of audio source node interfaces which share the ability to be started and stopped, optionally at specified times. Specifically, this interface defines the start() and stop() methods, as well as the onended event handler."><code>AudioScheduledSourceNode</code></a> which represents an audio source consisting of in-memory audio data, stored in an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBuffer" title="Objects of these types are designed to hold small audio snippets, typically less than 45 s. For longer sounds, objects implementing the MediaElementAudioSourceNode are more suitable. The buffer contains data in the following format:  non-interleaved IEEE754 32-bit linear PCM with a nominal range between -1 and +1, that is, 32bits floating point buffer, with each samples between -1.0 and 1.0. If the AudioBuffer has multiple channels, they are stored in separate buffer."><code>AudioBuffer</code></a>. It's especially useful for playing back audio which has particularly stringent timing accuracy requirements, such as for sounds that must match a specific rhythm and can be kept in memory rather than being played from disk or the network.
