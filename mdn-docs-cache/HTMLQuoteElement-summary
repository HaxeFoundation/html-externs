The <strong><code>HTMLQuoteElement</code></strong> interface provides special properties and methods (beyond the regular <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement" title="The HTMLElement interface represents any HTML element. Some elements directly implement this interface, others implement it via an interface that inherits it."><code>HTMLElement</code></a> interface it also has available to it by inheritance) for manipulating quoting elements, like <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote" title="The HTML &lt;blockquote&gt; Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the &lt;cite&gt; element."><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q" title="The HTML &lt;q&gt; element  indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. "><code>&lt;q&gt;</code></a>, but not the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite" title="The HTML Citation element (&lt;cite&gt;) is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include either the title or author or the URL of that work."><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></a> element.
