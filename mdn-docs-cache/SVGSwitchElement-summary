The <strong><code>SVGSwitchElement</code></strong> interface corresponds to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/switch" title="The &lt;switch&gt; SVG element evaluates the requiredFeatures, requiredExtensions and systemLanguage attributes on its direct child elements in order, and then processes and renders the first child for which these attributes evaluate to true. All others will be bypassed and therefore not rendered. If the child element is a container element such as a &lt;g&gt;, then the entire subtree is either processed/rendered or bypassed/not rendered."><code>&lt;switch&gt;</code></a> element.
