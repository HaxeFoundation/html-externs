The <code><strong>BroadcastChannel</strong></code> interface represents a named channel that any <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/browsing_context" class="glossaryLink" title="browsing context: A browsing context is the environment in which a browser displays a Document (normally a tab nowadays, but possibly also a window or a frame within a page).">browsing context</a> of a given <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/origin" class="glossaryLink" title="origin: Web content's origin is defined by the scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port of the URL used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, host, and port all match.">origin</a> can subscribe to. It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/message" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/message">message</a></code> event fired at all <code>BroadcastChannel</code> objects listening to the channel.
