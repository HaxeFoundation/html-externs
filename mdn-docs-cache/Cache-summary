The <strong><code>Cache</code></strong> interface provides a storage mechanism for <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request">Request</a></code> / <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> object pairs that are cached, for example as part of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker" title="The ServiceWorker interface of the ServiceWorker API provides a reference to a service worker. Multiple browsing contexts (e.g. pages, workers, etc.) can be associated with the same service worker, each through a unique ServiceWorker object."><code>ServiceWorker</code></a> life cycle. Note that the <code>Cache</code> interface is exposed to windowed scopes as well as workers. You don't have to use it in conjunction with service workers, even though it is defined in the service worker spec.
