The <strong><code>FormData</code></strong> interface provides a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be easily sent using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/send" title="The XMLHttpRequest method send() sends the request to the server."><code>XMLHttpRequest.send()</code></a> method. It uses the same format a form would use if the encoding type were set to <code>"multipart/form-data"</code>.
