The <strong><code>Headers</code></strong> interface of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch API</a> allows you to perform various actions on HTTP request and response headers. These actions include retrieving, setting, adding to, and removing. A <code>Headers</code> object has an associated header list, which is initially empty and consists of zero or more name and value pairs.  <span style="line-height: 19.0909080505371px;">You can add to this using methods like <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers/append" title="The append() method of the Headers interface appends a new value onto an existing header inside a Headers object, or adds the header if it does not already exist."><code>append()</code></a> (see <a href="#Examples">Examples</a>.) </span>In all methods of this interface, header names are matched by case-insensitive byte sequence.
