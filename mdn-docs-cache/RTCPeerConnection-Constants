<h3 id="RTCBundlePolicy_enum">RTCBundlePolicy enum</h3>

<p>The <code>RTCBundlePolicy</code> enum defines string constants which are used to request a specific policy for gathering ICE candidates if the remote peer isn't compatible with the <a href="https://webrtcstandards.info/sdp-bundle/">SDP BUNDLE standard</a> for bundling multiple media streams on a single transport link.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In technical terms, a BUNDLE lets all media flow between two peers flow across a single <strong>5-tuple</strong>; that is, from the same IP and port on one peer to the same IP and port on the other peer, using the same transport protocol.</p>

<p>The <code>RTCIceConnectionState</code> enum defines the string constants used to describe the current state of the ICE agent and its connection to the ICE server (that is, the {{Glossary("STUN")}} or {{Glossary("TURN")}} server).</p>

<p>The <code>RTCIceGatheringState</code> enum defines string constants which reflect the current status of ICE gathering, as returned using the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState")}} property.

<p>The <code>RTCPeerConnectionState</code> enum defines string constants which describe states in which the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> may be. These values are returned by the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.connectionState", "connectionState")}} property. This state essentially represents the aggregate state of all ICE transports (which are of type {{domxref("RTCIceTransport")}} or {{domxref("RTCDtlsTransport")}}) being used by the connection.</p>
