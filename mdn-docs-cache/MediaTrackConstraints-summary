The <strong><code>MediaTrackConstraints</code></strong> dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on. A constraints dictionary is passed into <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints" title="The applyConstraints() method of the MediaStreamTrack interface applies a set of constraints to the track; these constraints let the Web site or app establish ideal values and acceptable ranges of values for the constrainable properties of the track, such as frame rate, dimensions, echo cancelation, and so forth."><code>applyConstraints()</code></a> to allow a script to establish a set of exact (required) values or ranges and/or preferred values or ranges of values for the track, and the most recently-requested set of custom constraints can be retrieved by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getConstraints" title="The getConstraints() method of the MediaStreamTrack interface returns a MediaTrackConstraints object containing the set of constraints most recently established for the track using a prior call to applyConstraints(). These constraints indicate values and ranges of values that the Web site or application has specified are required or acceptable for the included constrainable properties."><code>getConstraints()</code></a>.
