The <code>BaseAudioContext</code> interface acts as a base definition for online and offline audio-processing graphs, as represented by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext" title="The AudioContext interface represents an audio-processing graph built from audio modules linked together, each represented by an AudioNode."><code>AudioContext</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/OfflineAudioContext" title="The OfflineAudioContext interface is an AudioContext interface representing an audio-processing graph built from linked together AudioNodes. In contrast with a standard AudioContext, an OfflineAudioContext doesn't render the audio to the device hardware; instead, it generates it, as fast as it can, and outputs the result to an AudioBuffer."><code>OfflineAudioContext</code></a> respectively.
