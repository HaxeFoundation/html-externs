A <strong><code>NodeFilter</code></strong> interface represents an object used to filter the nodes in a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator" title="The NodeIterator interface represents an iterator over the members of a list of the nodes in a subtree of the DOM. The nodes will be returned in document order."><code>NodeIterator</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker" title="The TreeWalker object represents the nodes of a document subtree and a position within them."><code>TreeWalker</code></a>. They don't know anything about the DOM or how to traverse nodes; they just know how to evaluate a single node against the provided filter.
