Note that as of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1112702" title="FIXED: Switch IndexedDB transactions to be non-durable by default">bug 1112702</a>.) Previously in a <code>readwrite</code> transaction <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBTransaction/oncomplete" title="The oncomplete event handler of the IDBTransaction interface handles the complete event, fired when the transaction successfully completes."><code>IDBTransaction.oncomplete</code></a> was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk. In Firefox 40+ the <code>complete</code> event is fired after the OS has been told to write the data but potentially before that data has actually been flushed to disk. The <code>complete</code> event may thus be delivered quicker than before, however, there exists a small chance that the entire transaction will be lost if the OS crashes or there is a loss of system power before the data is flushed to disk. Since such catastrophic events are rare most consumers should not need to concern themselves further.
